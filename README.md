We were using an Apache Web Server on Raspberry Pi with specific configurations set-up for Web C++ and CGI Programming, unfortunately, we could not send the whole Apache Web Server as it has special configurations and also was too big and was in stored in different locations on the Raspberry Pi so we could not submit it to both Bitbucket and OWL.

After discussing with Professor Katchabaw, he has allowed us to demo our project in front of the TAs because of the size of our project and for acceptance testing.

Moreover, our Doxygen docs is in the docs folder, a lot of our code is actual implementation or cpp files because we were using the built-in CGICC library that is on Apache Web Server to build a C++ web app.

We have also switched around some of our required and optional User Stories as we have asked Professor Katchabaw and he has given us permission due to some of the complexity with our required user stories.

To use our Apache Web Server, you would need to connect to the same Wifi network and then ssh into and can run on your browser. The files on their own can compile but cannot be run without Apache Web Server.

We would like to apologize for the added difficulty in testing our project.
